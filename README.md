## Getting started

2- Run `npm run install-all` to install all packages needed for each template at once, or navigate to the folder of a specific template and run `npm install`

3- Run `npm run build-all` to bundle all the code for each template and produce a .zip file (per template), which contains the template for usage on our FollowAnalytics platform.
